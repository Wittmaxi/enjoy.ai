# enjoy\.ai React Native Front-end

This is the mobile front-end project for the enjoy.ai project and requires either the [Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=sv&gl=US) or the Android [SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org) and npm
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client)

## Usage

#### Run it using the Expo app
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
- Scan the QR code from the Expo app to build and start enjoy\.ai

## Structure
The app consists of a very simple to use and intuitive base screen where the user can control the music and view all the information they need at a glance.
The other very important part of the app is the exhaustive and intelligent sensor usage to optimally fit the music to the users situation and surroundings.

### UI
The simple UI promotes direct usage when opening the app - no need to navigate around or tweak setting.

### Sensor data
The app uses multiple different sensors and data sources to properly be able to infer the vital parts of the surrounding environment for producing the perfect experience.
**Note:** Some of the sensor data is currently not implemented but simply mocked.
